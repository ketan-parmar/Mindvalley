# Mindvalley - Channel Module

### Notes
- Used MVVM architecture
- Used [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) to call APIs
- Used [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) for the parsing and managing json
- Used [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage) to cached and manage the images
- Used [Json Cafe](http://www.jsoncafe.com/) to generate model classes from the api response
- Installed all the libraries using CocoaPods

- I've used download request instead of normal request to download json response to the document directory. In normal request with default cache policy it stores data in cache memory but it is temporary and some time system erase the cache within couple of minutes so I've stored the json to the document directory and used it when internet is not available.

- I've stored and managed scroll positions of the collection views inside tableviews to provide better user experience

- We can add skelton views and animated place holders in future as a part of enhancement

### Version control
- I've used github to manage version controlling and below is the link,
