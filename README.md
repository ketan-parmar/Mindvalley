# Mindvalley

###
Q. What parts of the test did you find challenging and why?
A. Initially I've added all the tableview cells in the storyboard in the view controller itself and it looks very messay so it was hard to manage it and finally I've created the seperate xibs for every cell.

###
Q. What feature would you like to add in the future to improve the project?
A. For this project we can give support for the tablet(iPad), macOS(as per the new universal app support for every platform) and for every orientation.
Application have default dark theme so, we can design light theme and can display dark or light theme as per the device's settings.

### Notes
- Used MVVM architecture
- Used Alamofire to call APIs
- Used SwiftyJSON for the parsing and managing json
- Used SDWebImage to cached and manage the images
- Used [Json Cafe](http://www.jsoncafe.com/) to generate model classes from the api response
- Installed all the libraries using CocoaPods

- I've used download request instead of normal request to download json response to the document directory. In normal request with default cache policy it stores data in cache memory but it is temporary and some time system erase the cache within couple of minutes so I've stored the json to the document directory and used it when internet is not available.

- I've stored and managed scroll positions of the collection views inside tableviews to provide better user experience

- We can add skelton views and animated place holders in future as a part of enhancement

### Version control
- I've used github to manage version controlling and below is the link,
